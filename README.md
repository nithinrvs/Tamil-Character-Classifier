# Tamil Character Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying Tamil characters using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The goal is to build an accurate model that can recognize and classify Tamil script from given input images.

## Features

- Preprocessing of Tamil character images
- Feature extraction and transformation
- Model training using deep learning techniques
- Evaluation and accuracy analysis

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy & Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from HPLabs. It consists of labeled Tamil character images used for training and testing the model. The dataset includes a diverse set of handwritten and printed Tamil characters to ensure robust classification.

## CNN Algorithm

The model is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is highly effective for image classification tasks. The CNN architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to extract and classify features efficiently.

## Results

The CNN model achieves high accuracy in classifying Tamil characters. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning in recognizing complex script patterns. Performance metrics include:

- Training Accuracy : 78%
- Testing Accuracy : 72%
